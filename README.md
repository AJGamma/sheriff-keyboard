# Sheriff: A BLAZINGLY FAST, Feature-rich Ergonomic Keyboard for Beginners

Inspired by the Corax keyboard

- A LOT more keys than the corne, designed for beginners and multi-device folks
- Similar layout to the more traditional keyboard on notebooks, less mental overload for switching between devices
- Deep pinky stagger and smaller padding/spread, more comfortable for small-handed people
- Scrollwheel
- Reversible PCB
- Multiple positions for common modifier keys  (e.g. `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Shift`, `Cmd`) and multiple profiles designed for beginners who are not sure about their preferences yet
- Allows single-handed use
